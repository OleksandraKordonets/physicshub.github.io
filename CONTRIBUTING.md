## üîÑ Pull Request Process ‚Äî Step-by-Step (Beginner Friendly)

This guide will walk you through **setting up the project locally** and creating a **Pull Request (PR)**, even if it‚Äôs your first time contributing to an open-source project.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Setting up the project locally

0. **Install Dependences**
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - Check if [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and Node.js are installed with `npm -v` and `node -v`

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Go to the project‚Äôs [GitHub page](https://github.com/physicshub/physicshub.github.io).
   - Click the **Fork** button (top right) to create a copy of the repository under your account.

2. **Clone your fork to your computer**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/physicshub.github.io.git
   ```

3. **Navigate into the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd physicshub.github.io
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173` to see the site running locally.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make your changes

- You can:
  - Add new simulations
  - Improve UI/UX
  - Fix bugs
  - Update documentation
- Keep your code **clean, readable, and consistent** with the existing style.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Versioning

- Open `package.json` and update the `"version"` field.
- Follow **[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)**:
  - **MAJOR** ‚Üí Breaking changes (e.g., `2.0.0`)
  - **MINOR** ‚Üí New features, backward-compatible (e.g., `1.4.0`)
  - **PATCH** ‚Üí Bug fixes or small improvements (e.g., `1.3.1`)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ UI Changes

If you made **significant changes** to the interface:
1. Take screenshots of the updated UI.
2. Create a folder in:
   ```
   public/screenshots/NEW_VERSION
   ```
3. Save all screenshots there.
4. The main screenshot (usually the homepage) should be named:
   ```
   main.png
   ```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit and Push

1. **Stage your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. **Write a clear commit message**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "<Commit message>"
   ```
3. **Push your branch to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Fill in the PR description:
   - **What** you changed
   - **Why** you changed it
   - Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #12`)
   - Add screenshots/GIFs if relevant
4. Make sure the base branch is:
   ```
   base repository: physicshub/physicshub.github.io
   base: main
   ```
The title of your pull request should follow the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). When a pull request is merged to the main branch, all changes are going to be squashed into a single commit. The message of this commit will be the title of the pull request. And for every release, the commit messages are used to generate the changelog.

Here are some examples of conventional PR titles:

- `feat: add new icons for Rust`
- `fix: correct icon for .gitignore`
- `ci: add GitHub Actions for automated testing`

Generating the changelog based on the commit messages saves time and helps to keep the changelog up-to-date. It also helps to understand the changes in the project.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Review and Merge

- Wait for the repository owner to review your PR.
- If changes are requested:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Fix: updated UI based on review"
  git push
  ```
- Once approved:
  - If you have write permissions ‚Üí you can merge.
  - If not ‚Üí the maintainer will merge for you.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Adding you to contributors

- When the merge is approved and done, you can add you to the contributors section in the README.md 
- To know how to do it check the contributors section in the README.md or [here](https://github.com/physicshub/physicshub.github.io/issues/25).
